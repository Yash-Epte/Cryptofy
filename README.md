## üìñ About This Project

Cryptofy is a full-stack application designed for cryptocurrency price prediction. Its core feature is a Python backend that trains a new **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model on the fly for each prediction request. This ensures the forecast is always based on the latest market data available from the CoinGecko API.

The Flutter application provides a clean interface for users to select a cryptocurrency, view its historical price data, and see a 24-hour price forecast generated by the model.

## Features

  * **Live Model Training:** A new LSTM model is trained on fresh data for every prediction request.
  * **24-Hour Forecasting:** Generates an hour-by-hour price forecast for the next 24 hours.
  * **Historical Data Charts:** Displays historical price data for "Past 24 Hours" and "Past 30 Days."
  * **Real-time Data:** Fetches all market data directly from the CoinGecko API.
  * **Model Accuracy Score:** The API returns the **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination) score** to indicate the model's fit to the training data.
  * **Cross-Platform:** Built with Flutter for a single codebase on both iOS and Android.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is separated into a frontend mobile app and a backend server.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

  * **Flutter & Dart**: The core framework for the mobile UI.
  * **flutter\_riverpod**: Used for modern, robust state management.
  * **fl\_chart**: For rendering clean, interactive price charts.
  * **http**: For making network requests to the backend API.

### Backend (`/backend`)

  * **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for serving the API.
  * **TensorFlow (Keras)**: For building and training the 3-layer LSTM neural network.
  * **Scikit-learn**: Used for data preprocessing (`MinMaxScaler`) and model evaluation (`r2_score`).
  * **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and time-series dataset creation.
  * **Requests**: For fetching data from the external CoinGecko API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  * [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & `pip`

### 1\. Backend Setup

First, create a `requirements.txt` file inside your `/backend` directory with the following content:

**`backend/requirements.txt`**

```
flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
requests
tensorflow
matplotlib
```

Now, set up and run the server:

```sh
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server (will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000)
flask run
```

### 2\. Frontend Setup

1.  In a **new terminal**, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install Flutter dependencies:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  Ensure your backend server is running from Step 1.
4.  Run the app on your emulator or physical device:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
